VERY WIP!!!! THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY A PROOF OF CONCEPT.

Currently, this mod requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) and [DebugPlus](https://github.com/WilsontheWolf/DebugPlus).

In the console, write 'eval suika()' to start or restart the game. Write 'eval disable_suika()' to hide the game.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the indicator left or right. Use the down arrow key to drop balls. Try to create the coveted 11 ball!
